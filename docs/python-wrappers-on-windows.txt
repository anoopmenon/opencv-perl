A quick HOWTO for installing the Python wrappers on Windows.

You need to have Python 2.6 installed. If it is installed prior to OpenCV,
then OpenCV installer will detect it and will install the wrappers.

To recompile the wrappers from scratch, you will also need Visual Studio 2005 or 2008
(any edition, Express, Standard, Professional ...) with the properly set environment
variables (INCLUDE, LIB, PATH). The variables can be set either during installation,
or using <Visual Studio Install Directory>\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat.

Launch the command shell.
Enter <OpenCV Install Directory>\interfaces\swig\python.
Type
    
    python setup-for-win.py

Look at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/ if you have any
comments, or if you need help about OpenCV.
