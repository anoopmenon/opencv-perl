Dear Python-fan,

we've been working on OpenCV for Python for quite a long time now
and it's time to show what we achieved so far. The interface seems
to be mostly complete, still lacking some functions that take
double pointers as arguments and automatic type conversions are 
missing. The biggest problem for production use is the improper
(= missing) memory management. If you use Python/OpenCV for 
interactive experiments and small prototyping projects, this is
no big deal, for larger datasets and stability this needs to be
addressed and solved carefully.

Please take a look at the python samples that ship with OpenCV.
You will likely find what's necessary to get started with OpenCV
and Python in the demo code.

Feel free to experiment, find bugs and report them.
