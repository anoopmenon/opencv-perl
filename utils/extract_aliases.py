This script extracts macros #defines from those OpenCV headers that can't be
directly parsed by current SWIG versions and must be pre-filtered by
the C preprocessor (that erases all #defines).  Type information is missing in the 
macros, so C code can't be regenerated.  Instead, try to convert C to Python code.
C macros too complicated to represent in python using regexes are listed in EXCLUDE
